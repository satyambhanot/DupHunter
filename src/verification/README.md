# Verification: checking and ranking candidates, big buckets

**Owner:** Navjot Singh Shienh (#29, #30)

| File | What it does | Experiment |
|---|---|---|
| `verify.py` | Exact Jaccard similarity for every LSH candidate pair; ranked candidate lists | E4 (#29) |
| `rerank.py` | TF-IDF cosine re-ranking of the top candidates (stretch) | E4 (#29) |
| `buckets.py` | Bucket-size profile; size limit vs. splitting big buckets (salting) vs. dropping common shingles | E7 (#30) |

**Our code vs. libraries:** all our own code, built on Spark DataFrames.
